        <h1 class="section-title">About<span> S</span>asuke Uchiha</h1>
        <p>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ, Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan. After his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend, Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills. Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (支う影, Sasaukage, literally meaning: Supporting Shadow).</p>

            <p>Sasuke Uchiha is a member of the Uchiha clan and thus, possesses the visual Kekkei Genkai known as the Sharingan. This eye is incredibly powerful and allows a user to read the movements of others better. It also lets the users copy the techniques of others, although it takes quite some time to master them</p>

            <h2>One Tomoe Sharingan</h2>
            <p>Sasuke Uchiha is a member of the Uchiha clan and thus, possesses the visual Kekkei Genkai known as the Sharingan. This eye is incredibly powerful and allows a user to read the movements of others better. It also lets the users copy the techniques of others, although it takes quite some time to master them.

                One Tomoe Sharingan is the weakest eye of the Uchiha Clan in the series and although it's a decent power-up, it only unlocks a fraction of what this eye is truly capable of. Sasuke Uchiha unlocked this eye during the Uchiha clan massacre, however, the trauma made him forget that he ever unlocked it, to begin with. During the Land of Waves arc, Sasuke re-awakened this power for the first time since that incident.</p>

            <h1>Sharingan</h1>
            <h2>Two Tomoe Sharingan</h2>
            <p>This form of the Sharingan is an evolution of the eye with a single tomoe and is much stronger than it. Expectedly, it grants the user all the powers that the first Sharingan does but it does so in a much better way. The movements that a user of the two tomoe Sharingan can read are much more refined and precise and thus, it helps them react to dangers much better. This eye can also copy any form of ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu as long as they're not Kekkei Genkai or Hiden techniques. Sasuke gained this eye during the Land of Waves arc and with time and it allowed him to read the movements of characters such as Rock Lee, copy them, and use them in battle. Later, this eye evolved into a fully matured Sharingan.</p>

            <h1>Sharingan</h1>
            <h2>Three Tomoe Sharingan</h2>
            <p>A Sharingan is known to mature completely when the user awakens all three tomoe in the eye. This is the strongest form of the regular Sharingan and an Uchiha with this eye can see to a much greater extent when compared to others. Sasuke awakened this eye during his fight against Naruto at the Valley of the End. After awakening this eye, he was able to keep track of the movements of Naruto in his One-Tailed Cloak, something that he couldn't do before that.
                This eye can also be used to cast powerful genjutsu, and as with all the other versions of the Sharingan, it can see through all ninjutsu, genjutsu, and taijutsu. While there are limits to it, a great user of the Sharingan can even surpass someone with an eye stronger than it with training.</p>

            <h2>Chidori</h2>
            <p>Chidori is a jutsu created by Kakashi Hatake. Kakashi eventually taught the jutsu to his student, Sasuke. The jutsu became Sasuke's signature attack.
                When he first created the technique, he discovered it was too dangerous to use. After Kakashi received the Sharingan, he realized that was what he needed to complete the jutsu. Without the Sharingan, he couldn't process the world quickly enough to safely use Chidori. While the lightning style attack could technically be used by anyone, the Sharingan is needed to safely use this jutsu.</p>

            <h2>Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu</h2>
            <p>An early favorite, the Phoenix Flower Jutsu was a common offensive technique used by Sasuke. Sasuke would often combine the method with shurikens hidden in the small flame volleys. The combination led to a reliable technique that had a range to it.
                 Part of what makes this jutsu so compelling is the difficulty many enemies have dodging the flame bullets. There are so many flames lobbed at the opponent that the technique is almost impossible to avoid. Sasuke is able to control the fire with his chakra, so every single volley is difficult to doge. For one of the first jutsus, many viewers saw Sasuke use it definitely packed a wallop.</p>

            <h2>Kirin</h2>
            <p>Now Kirin is only ahead of the Susanoo technique because of the fact it destroyed Itachi’s Susanoo. The move is a dominant offensive technique. Sasuke cannot use this technique all the time, but when he has enough chakra, it can be a dangerous attack.
               The technique relies on natural lightning, so the user has to exhaust their chakra to make thunder clouds if not there are none around. Once the lightning strikes, the user is able to shape it with his chakra. The move can only be used once because the attack evaporates all the thunder clouds in the area. However, it can destroy a small mountain, and, as mentioned earlier, even an ultimate defense like the Susanoo.</p>

            <h2>Lions Barrage</h2>
            <p>Sasuke had a challenge in front of him during the preliminary match of the final round of the Chunin exam. Kakashi told him that he could not use his chakra or the curse seal would activate. Given this restriction, Sasuke utilized taijutsu instead and was assisted by his fight with Rock Lee (he copied his movements with the Sharingan).
                The results of this complicated scenario were the invention of a new technique. Sasuke combined the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf and the beginning of the front lotus to craft a new powerful combo. The move is called Lions Barrage in the English anime and involves multiple quick strikes to elevate the opponent to an incredible height. From here, Sasuke basically bicycle kicks the opponent with enough force to rapidly drive them to the ground. When it makes enough contact, it can be a punishing move.

            <h2>Binding Snake Glare Spell</h2>
            <p>Yes, more snakes for this entry. Sasuke uses a lot of snakes if that has not become clear. This one is a tad more potent than the others. Again, Sasuke utilizes this in rare instances, but if one considers the full capability this one amounts to an amazing power.
                Some of the most powerful shinobi could likely not escape this jutsu. It binds the target with two powerful snakes and then constricts them. The Binding Snake Glare Spell even has poisonous capabilities (if the snake bites the enemy). That added threat means this attack can continue to damage opponents after its used.</p>

            <h2>Manda</h2>
            <p>The ability to complete a summoning contract is nothing new in the series. Since fans were introduced to it, they have seen a multitude of creatures assist shinobi in battle. However, no animal is as threatening as Manda.
                Manda is the strongest large serpent fans know about (unless you count his clone, Manda II, which is still technically him).  Being able to summon him is no easy feat, and as the boss summons of snakes, he takes a lot of power to be used as an ally. Luckily, Sasuke is able to subdue him with genjutsu and utilize the durability of Manda to save his life. It’s a staggering feat and only someone as powerful as Sasuke could achieve it.

            <p>Sasuke is so strong he has many summoning techniques, unlike most ninja who cannot even summon one creature. On top of snakes, Sasuke can also summon hawks. The staple hawk that Sasuke summons is Garuda. Sasuke proves this idea a multitude of times during the series.
                Garuda is another boss summon. He is a large bird that seems incredibly trusting and helps Sasuke out of lots of dangerous situations. Garuda is the ally that most ninja’s desire from a summoning jutsu. He even saves Sasuke and Naruto during their fight with Kaguya. Having a trusted, secure summon like Garuda just makes Sasuke even more of a threat to any opponent</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This is the first of the Sharingan developments this list mentions. The Sharingan itself is a powerful Kekkei Genkai. The user is able to copy jutsus and match the opponent’s moves. However, when a user unlocks the Mangekyo Sharingan, they unlock even more abilities.
             Now most fans know that those abilities are technically considered separate from the Mangekyo itself. Those techniques can be used once someone unlocks the Mangekyo Sharingan by seeing someone close to them die. The new ability allows the user to avoid the chakra drain of the traditional fully-realized Sharingan. The way this technique unlocks more power makes it a powerful tool for Sasuke to use.</p>

            <p>TThis entry is a big-time ability unlocked through the Mangekyo Sharingan. Itachi Uchiha is a master of this technique, and Sasuke shows the same ability once he opens this power. This is one of the ultimate skills of the Mangekyo Sharingan users.
                Amaterasu is a technique that allows the caster to summon black flames that can burn for over a week. These black flames cannot be extinguished by reasonable means. Amaterasu is even more dangerous because it can used as both an offensive and defensive maneuver. The flexibility makes it a staple power for Sasuke to use.   </p>

            <p>This is a complicated entry. The Susanoo is only opened once the user unlocks Mangekyo Sharingan. Once both eyes are unlocked, the user must go through stages of developing their Susanoo, a human avatar made of chakra that assists the caster in battle.
              Once Sasuke reaches the complete body stage of casting the Susanoo, his full potential with the technique is discovered. The ability puts him under a lot of strain. However, once he casts the Susanoo, he gains an excellent defense with an offensive ability with no range limit. That power is a two-fold destructive weapon. Sasuke is one of the only shinobi fans see use this magnificent technique.</p>

              <p>TSasuke learns how to wield many weapons for max damage. In fact, Sasuke has a tremendous knack for kenjutsu. That being said, the most powerful of these is his Sword of Kusanagi.
                  What fully encapsulates this weapon is Sasuke’s Chidori being fused with it. This creates a Chidori blade with a considerable threat for anyone who has to face Sasuke in battle when he uses it. When an opponent is stabbed by the Chidori Katana, they then become numb and lose the ability to move. It’s a stunning power that destroys enemies and gives Sasuke the upper-hand.</p>

              <p>The Eternal Mangekyō merge the designs of the transplanter and the transplantee's original Mangekyō. Their Mangekyō-based abilities are made stronger and they no longer suffer any negative side-effects from the usage. According to Madara, the Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan is proof an Uchiha continues to seek something despite experiencing great losses. Should the eyes evolve to this state, the user will retain all their previous techniques from their original eyes. In addition to the unique techniques, the "straight tomoe" (直巴, Choku Tomoe) form of Madara's and Sasuke's Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan grants them fluidity in their movements when fighting</p>

            <p>The Susanoo is capable of immense abilities, but Sasuke is such a fantastic ninja that he utilizes it past the standard skills. The Susanoo protects Sasuke while he unleashes a fire release of black flames. This black flame is then wielded as a weapon for the Susanoo to use.
                This black flame can be turned into a multitude of powerful weapons. Fans see it transformed into a bow and arrow, a sword, and even magatama-shaped projectiles. The weapon is able to incinerate anyone struck by it and only continues to damage them as it continues.

              <p>So how is Sasuke so fast? Well, the Rinnegan is what helps Sasuke perform some of the most powerful moves in his arsenal. The Rinnegan is an ultimate technique that allows Sasuke to see chakra and see how it flows through the body. That ability is the tip of the iceberg.
                  No kidding here, the Rinnegan is one of Sasuke’s best cards. The technique lets him use the six paths technique (these are complex and not discussed in the list). On top of this, Sasuke can entirely copy all jutsus and, ultimately, unlock the full potential of the Sharingan. Plus, the Rinnegan is what opens this ability to move through space and time. There are not enough words to fully explain just how incredible this technique is and how much it helps Sasuke once he has unlocked it.</p>

            <h2>Space-Time Dojutsu</h2>
            <p>Being fast is useful, especially for a shinobi. Taijutsu is what one usually relates to speed, but Sasuke is a particular case. No, seriously, Sasuke is one of the few ninjas capable of moving through space and time like this.
                The ability cast a black portal that allows Sasuke to move through dimensions and then move through time. The ability drains Sasuke of chakra and keeps him from using skills that are of extreme value to him. Still, Sasuke literally moves through space and time that is nothing to scoff at.</p>

              <h2>Amenotejikara</h2>
              <p>So, here is another example of Sasuke moving fast quickly. Sasuke uses another space-time ninjutsu as a way to prevent massive damage from big attacks. This technique allows Sasuke to substitute places with an object or person.
                Sasuke uses his eyes to shift locations with something, and this opens up Sasuke to attack an unsuspecting opponent. The move literally happens in an instant and gives Sasuke the ability to place himself in the right position tactically. It is like the substitute jutsu on steroids. The Amenotejikara not only switches places with the opponent but they still carry the momentum after the technique is used. It allows Sasuke to disorient the enemy and overtake them in a battle.

              <p>The Deva Path (天道, Tendō), which allows one to manipulate both attractive and repulsive forces.
                The Asura Path (修羅道, Shuradō), which grants the user mechanised limbs, weaponry and armour.
                The Human Path (人間道, Ningendō), which gives the ability to remove a soul and so, read a person's mind.
                The Animal Path (畜生道, Chikushōdō), which lets the user summon a wide variety of creatures.
                The Preta Path (餓鬼道, Gakidō), which can absorb all forms of chakra, including most ninjutsu.
                The Naraka Path (地獄道, Jigokudō), through which one can summon and control the King of Hell.
                The Outer Path (外道, Gedō), which rules over both life and death.

              <h2>Six Paths Of Yin Power</h2>
              <p>So by this point in the series, the amount of power being displayed had officially jumped the shark. Both Naruto and Sasuke were reaching max power, and this additional power-up sealed it. The Six Paths of Yin Power is given to Sasuke after being wielded by Hamura and Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki.
                Not much is known about the exact details of this power. What is known is that it gives Sasuke extraordinary power and when combined with Naruto’s Six Paths of Yang Power it unleashes an incredible technique (more on that later). Still, even if it is only seen for a brief time, the power it grants Sasuke cannot be understated.

          <h2>Indra Susanoo</h2>
          <p>Because of his Rinnegan, Sasuke can use the wings of his Complete Body Susanoo to block out the light of the Infinite Tsukuyomi. ... Sasuke is able to perform his Chidori through this so-called "Indra Susanoo" (インドラ須佐能乎, Indora Susanoo), as well as Fire Release: Great Fireball Technique in the anime.

              <h1>Abilities of Rinnegan</h1>
              <h2>Indra's Arrow</h2>
              <p>This is the big one. Now, although the previous entry is a top of line sealing method, it takes two to tango. Instead, Indra’s Arrow is the top power because Sasuke uses it without help. The move is named after Indra the first user of the Susanoo technique.
                Sasuke uses this in coordination with his Susanoo, and, honestly, some consider it the most powerful offensive technique in the entire series. However, that cannot be proven. Sasuke creates a longbow and arrow in coordination with his lightning release. He absorbs the nine tails chakra and then uses that power to boost his arrow’s ability. The move is so strong it seems to match Naruto’s Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken. That result means its likely at least tied for the best move in the entire series, and that just sums up how powerful Sasuke is as a shinobi.

              <h2>Six Paths — Chibaku Tensei</h2>
              <p>So the earlier entry mentioned the Six Paths of Yin Power. The full ability is not evident in that entry, but it’s better understood in its final use. See, the Six Paths of Yin Power is used by Sasuke, and Naruto combines his Six Paths of Yang Power to create this powerful technique.
                Naruto and Sasuke combine their yin and yang release to reseal Kaguya. That is the big moment in the series. The two have peaked concerning power, and they combine their ability to defeat what basically amounts to God in this world. It’s the ultimate sealing technique that most fans will likely never see again.
